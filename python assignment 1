## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ANS: 	Python is widely supported, human readable and easy to code. by the help of compiler or interpreter it's convert to machine i.e. binary language.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
ANs: 	we don't need to declare the data type of variable, it assigned at run time according to data value.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
ANS: 	The pros of Python:
	Python is easy to learn and read
	Python enhances productivity
	Python has a vast collection of libraries

	The cons of python programming language
	While your program runs in Python, it has to do more work in line-by-line execution, so the process will be slow. 
	Python consumes a lot of memory space


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
ANS:	Web development
	Data science
	OS development
	Scientific programming


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
ANS:	variables are the name of memory location which contains inputed data.

	DATA_TYPE VARIABLE__NAME = VALUE
e.g.  	int a = 10; 		----	in C#
	int_var	= 10		--	in python


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
ANS:	we can take input by using input function, user can set value through output terminal.

E.g.	a = input("ENTER SOME WORD!!")	
	
	#	than we can print that value using print function.
	print(a) 
	

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
ANS:	string


Q8. What is type casting?
ANS:  convert one datatype to another

E.g.   a = 10.12
	b= int(a)

	output: 10


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
ANS:	NO, we can put one input at a time 


Q10. What are keywords?
ANS: Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
ANS: NO, we can't use keywords as varible because keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes.
e.g. if,elif,else


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
ANS:	a tab(4 space) from the left side of screen is indentation, it is used to provide statement of blocks.
e.g.

if(conditon):
	statements



Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
ANS: Using print function.


Q14. What are operators in Python?
ANS: operators are used to get a solution using one variable or more i.e. +,-,*,%,/


Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
ANS:	/	division with float output
	//	division with int output


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
ANS:	a= 'iNeuron'
	b= a* 4
	print(a * 4)
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
ANS:	
	b= int(input("enter a number"))

	if(b%2 == 1):
    		print("Number:",b,"is odd.")
	else:
    		print("Number:",b,"is even.")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
ANS:	True or False

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 = 1

0 and 0 = 0

True and False and True = False

1 or 0 or 0 = 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
ANS:	
	decision making statement , if one ans isn't true than other answer.

e.g.   if else statements


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

ANS:	decision making statement,if expression satisfy first condition than code stop there,
	if not true, than move to 2nd cond. and go on.

e.g.
b= int(input("enter marks of student:"))

if(b >= 70):
    print("Number:",b,"are good.")
elif(b<70 and b>=40):
    print("Number:",b,"are average.")
else:
    print("Number:",b,"are poor.")


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
ANS:	
age = int(input("age of person: "))

if(age >= 18):
    print("I can vote")

else:
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
ANS:

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
a = numbers[0]+ numbers[2] + numbers[3] +numbers[6]
print(a)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
ANS:

number_1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
number_2 = int(input("Enter Second number: "))
number_3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

if(number_1 >   number_2):
    if(number_1 >   number_3):
        print("number_1 ",number_1,"is greatest")
    else:
        print("number_3 ",number_3,"is greatest")
elif(number_1   <   number_2):
    if(number_2 >   number_3):
        print("number_2 ",number_2,"is greatest")
    else:
        print("number_3 ",number_3,"is greatest")


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]


ANS: we might need to use array and loop here,so i will pick once we move to those topics.

	please advice me if we can proceed without it.
thanks
